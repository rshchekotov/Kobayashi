# Mochi VSCode Extension

This is a VSCode extension for the Mochi programming language.
Currently it provides only syntax highlighting, in the future, as the language logic itself grows
it will get more features, i.e. code completion, linting, etc.

A [minimal mochi document](./sample/default.mochi) can be found in the sample folder.
